Reform UK outpolled the Tories among Gen Z voters on July 4, a new study has revealed.

In a major blow to the Conservative Party, YouGov claimed 9.5 per cent of 18 to 30-year-olds supported Nigel Farage‚Äôs populist party.

Support for the Tories was marginally behind, sitting at just eight per cent.

The YouGov research suggests Reform was the third most popular party among voters aged 30 and under at the election, behind Labour and the Green Party.

Farage has become increasingly excited about his prospects with younger voters, with Reform UK pushing its message on social media platform TikTok.

Speaking about support from under-30s, Farage told The Telegraph:‚ÄúThe youth thing is really interesting, something very big is happening."

Tory candidates hit by damning new poll as new favourite emerges in race to become next party leader
PA/Savanta
A new favourite has emerged in the race to replace Rishi Sunak as the next Tory leader as the potential candidates were hit with a damning new poll.

Although all the candidates polled positively among Conservative voters, none of the potential candidates scored positively with the public.

In a fresh poll by Savanta UK, Tom Tugendhat was shown to be the most popular Conservative leadership contender among both the general public and Tory voters.

Results showed the Shadow Minister for Security scored a minus three with the wider public in a favourability rating of each of the top potential candidates but scored a +21 with Tory voters.

Shadow Home Secretary James Cleverly came in second place with a +19 among Tory voters but a -9 with the wider public.

Then came Kemi Badenoch and Suella Braverman with -12 and -23 among the wider public respectively.

In last place was Priti Patel who scored a -28 among the public and a mere seven with Tory voters.

The polling was conducted between July 19-21 and polled 2,312 UK adults.

The Tory leadership hopeful said: "I‚Äôm not going to criticise David Lammy for using the Government plane.

"The Foreign Secretary must be able to travel directly, flexibly, and at short notice.

"But the criticism of me from Labour when I flew on government business now reeks of hypocrisy."

Cleverly comments came after Angela Rayner blasted former Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for using the same jet.

Rayner described Truss' trip as a "disgusting waste" of taxpayers' money for "vanity and comfort".

Labour in turmoil over DWP two-child benefit cap as calls continue to pull 670,000 children out of poverty
The Labour Party has faced its first revolt from its own MPs since returning to Government over the issue of the two-child benefit cap as experts warn 670,000 young people are at risk of being plunged into poverty.

Seven Labour MPs have had the whip suspended for the next six months after voting against an amendment to scrap the controversial Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) policy.

In Parliament, MPs rejected the amendment by 363 votes to 103 which was put forward by the SNP.

However, experts have warned that waiting to end the two-child benefit cap will lead to more households being pushed below the poverty line.

Paul Johnson, the director of the independent Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), warned that the cap will impact around one in ten families by the end of this Parliament.

Rupert Lowe issues warning over 'brutal consequences' of immigration
Commons TV

Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe has argued that legal and illegal immigration have had ‚Äúbrutal consequences‚Äù on the UK.

Speaking during PMQs, the former chairman of Southampton FC said: ‚ÄúMy constituents in Great Yarmouth have little doubt that out-of-control legal and illegal immigration since 1997 has damaged and disrupted their community, and undermined their public services.

‚ÄúDoes the Prime Minister agree that importing millions of people, with no thought whatsoever to the brutal consequences, has failed our country? I know the good people of Great Yarmouth would much appreciate a yes or no answer to this straightforward question.‚Äù

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer replied: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I agree with his numbers. But look, I do think that it‚Äôs serious that the previous Government lost control of our borders.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a serious issue that requires a serious answer and that is why we will set up our Border Security Command to take down the gangs that are running this vile trade. What we won‚Äôt do is waste further time on a gimmick that cost a fortune and removed just four volunteers.‚Äù

Stephen Flynn has joked that Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party were now sitting "too close for comfort" now they have joined him on the Opposition bench.

The SNP's leader in Westminster said: "May I again warmly congratulate the Prime Minister on ending Tory rule. In his campaign to do so, he was of course -"

Flynn was then cut off by laughter and heckles from MPs, including from one Tory MP who shouted 'and yours' in relation to the SNP rule in Scotland, before he said Sunak and his Party were "too close for comfort now".

He continued to ask: "In his campaign to do, so he was of course joined by Gordon Brown, and just five days before the General Election in Scotland on the front page of the Daily Record, Gordon Brown instructed voters to vote Labour to end child poverty.

"Yet last night, Labour MPs from Scotland were instructed to retain the two child cap which forces children into poverty. So Prime Minister, what changed?‚Äù

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer replied: "I‚Äôm glad he mentioned Gordon Brown because the last Labour Government lifted millions of children out of poverty, something we‚Äôre very very proud of and this Government will approach the question with the same vigour with our new task force. Already we‚Äôve taken steps, breakfast clubs, abolishing no-fault evictions, decent homes."

Flynn was reprimanded by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle for holding a printout of the Daily Record headline he referred to, with Sir Lindsay saying: "Props are not allowed to be used. Never mind put it down. We don‚Äôt need any more."

PMQs: Starmer jokes he's 'more used to seeing Ed Davey in wetsuit'

Starmer jokes he's 'more used to seeing Ed Davey in wetsuit'
Commons TV

Sir Keir Starmer has joked that "he's more used to seeing Ed Davey in a wetsuit" after the Lib Dem leader's antics during the General Election Campaign.

Addressing the Commons, Davey said: "Thank you Mr Speaker and can I welcome the Prime Minister to his place in his first PMQs?

"Can I associate myself and my party with the comments he made about your attack on the soldier in Kent, our thoughts are with his family and friends and comrades, and I also associate myself with his comments on team GB and how we want them to succeed in Paris.

"The Prime Minister has many messes that he‚Äôs inherited, one of them is the scandal over the carers' allowance repayments. One of my constituents Andrea, who is a full-time carer for her elderly mum and who went back to work part-time for mental health, tells me she was earning less than ¬£7,000 a year and has been hit by a bill from the DWP for ¬£4,600.

"She is just one of tens of thousands of carers facing these repayments, punished for working, and earning just a few more pounds than the earnings limit so will the Prime Minister agree to meet with me and other family carers to try to resolve this matter?

Starmer jokingly replied "Can I thank the honourable member for raising this.

"He has of course been a tireless advocate for carers and I don‚Äôt think any of us could be anything other than moved when we saw the video of him and his son put out during the election campaign.

"He talks about Team GB, I'm glad he's in a suit today because we're more used to seeing him in a wetsuit."

The comment was met by laughter from MPs including Davey.

Starmer continued: ‚ÄúBut in relation to this issue we have a more severe crisis than we thought as we go through the books of the last 14 years. (The Conservatives) don‚Äôt like it, there was a reason the electorate rejected them so profoundly.

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôll review the challenges that we face. We do want to work with the sector and where we can across the House to create a national care service covering all these aspects and we‚Äôll start with carers and those that work in the care sector with a fair pay agreement.‚Äù

Rishi Sunak
Rishi Sunak addresses Commons
Commons TV

Rishi Sunak has said he ‚Äúvery much welcomes‚Äù words committing the UK Government to ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äôs irreversible path to Nato membership‚Äù.

The former Prime Minister urged Sir Keir Starmer to confirm ‚Äúfatuous Russian claims on Ukrainian territory must not act as a block to Ukraine joining the Nato defensive alliance‚Äù.

The Prime Minister Sir Keir replied: ‚ÄúIt is for Nato allies to decide who is a member of Nato.

‚ÄúFormed 75 years ago, a proud and probably most successful alliance that‚Äôs ever been formed, and that‚Äôs why it was really important at the summit that we were able to say there is now this irreversible path to membership. That‚Äôs a step forward from a year ago, and President Zelensky was very pleased we‚Äôve been able to make that successful transition.‚Äù

Sunak continued: ‚ÄúThanks to the complex legal and diplomatic work that the UK has led over the past several months, together with our allies Canada and America, the Prime Minister will I hope now find that there is a sound and established legal basis to go further on sanctions and seize Russian assets, and use them to fund Ukrainian reconstruction.

‚ÄúThat work has taken time but I hope he is able to take a look at it, and can he confirm for the House that this work is something that he will take forward, because if he does, I can assure him that the opposition will support him in doing so?‚Äù

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer replied: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for this opportunity to say how united we were on the question of sanctions across this House.

‚ÄúThe use now made of what has been seized and frozen is an important issue on which I think we can move forward, and I know the Chancellor is already beginning to have some discussions about how we can take more effective measures.

‚ÄúAgain, I will seek to reach out across the House as we do this important work together.‚Äù

Tory merger with Farage rejected outright by leadership candidate on day one of race
PA
A merger between the Conservative Party and Reform UK has been rejected outright by a top leadership candidate.

James Cleverly shut down the idea of a merger with Nigel Farage‚Äôs Party which could have united those on the right of the party under one banner if he were to become the next Tory leader.

So far, Cleverly is the only contender to have released a video announcing his bid, while Conservative MP for Wetherby and Easingwold Sir Alec Shelbrooke has nominated former Home Secretary Priti Patel for the position.

‚ÄúThe Conservative Party doesn‚Äôt do mergers‚Äù Cleverly told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme.

‚ÄúThe simple truth is that we have got a series of principles.‚Äù

Nominations in the contest to become the next Conservative Party leader opened today in the race to replace Rishi Sunak.

Other potential leadership contenders include shadow communities secretary Kemi Badenoch, former work and pensions secretary Mel Stride, former home secretary Dame Priti Patel, shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat and former immigration minister Robert Jenrick.

Under plans drawn up by the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs and the party board, the Tories will elect their new leader on November 2.

Nominations will open on Wednesday evening and close in the afternoon on July 29.

Sunak, who will remain acting leader until a successor is appointed, has given his backing to the plans and said a ‚Äúsmooth and orderly transition‚Äù is in the ‚Äúnational interest‚Äù.

Yvette Cooper blasts Tory record on law and order as new ONS crime data revealed
PA
Yvette Cooper has slammed the Conservatives' record on law and order after new Office for National Statistics crime data was released today.

The data which looked at crime in England and Wales in the year ending March 2024 showed victim-based crime has generally decreased over the last 10 years with some notable exceptions, such as sexual assault.

However, shoplifting has seen major increases and remains at its highest level in 20 years. In addition, robbery, offences involving knives or sharp instruments and offences involving firearms have also increased over the last year while remaining below pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels.

The Home Secretary, commenting on today‚Äôs crime figures from the Office for National Statistics, said: ‚ÄúThese figures show the disgraceful dereliction of the last Tory Government on law and order ‚Äì they deserted our town centres and high streets, leaving local people to face soaring levels of street crime.

‚ÄúShoplifting has shot up to 20-year highs, hitting our local businesses and hurting communities in our towns and cities, yet the number of neighbourhood police on our streets has plummeted, with devastating consequences for public confidence. Knife crime, which tears families apart, has risen yet again, and we‚Äôve seen a steep rise in stalking and harassment offences which disproportionately impact women and girls.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt carry on like this. This Labour government will put neighbourhood police back on the beat in our town centres, with stronger laws on knife crime, shoplifting and assaults on shop workers to keep our communities safe.

‚ÄúLabour has set an unprecedented mission to halve serious violence in ten years and to restore confidence in policing and the criminal justice system. We will be a government of law and order that puts the safety and security of our communities at its heart.‚Äù

Nigel Farage has accused the Home Office of wanting to "bury" illegal immigration by swapping the word "illegal" for "irregular."

In a post on social media, the Home Office said it was "taking control of irregular migration."

It comes as Home Office figures showed nearly 1,500 migrants had arrived in the UK on small boats across the Channel in one week.

Some 1,499 people made the journey in 27 boats from July 15 to 21, while the French coastguard confirmed two people died amid rescue operations off the northern French coast.

An SNP amendment to the King's Speech on the two-child benefit cap was defeated in Parliament last night.

Stephen Flynn tabled an amendment which would have allowed parents to claim child tax credit or universal credit for more than two children.

The amendment was defeated after just 103 MPs voted in favour of it, while 363 voted against.

Of those 103, seven of them were Labour MPs, despite the Government whipping them to vote against the amendment.

Eluned Morgan is expected to be named the new leader of Welsh Labour and likely First Minister of Wales today.

She will replace Vaughan Gething, who announced his resignation last week after a torrid four months in office, featuring rows over donations and sacked ministers.

Baroness Morgan, 57, the current Welsh health minister, is the only contender to be the Welsh Labour Party‚Äôs new leader, with nominations closing at midday.

When confirmed, she would become the first woman to lead the Welsh Government.

Welsh Conservatives have already said they will be asking for a recall if she wins, with party leader Andrew RT Davies saying this would ‚Äúgive Wales greater stability‚Äù.

But Plaid Cymru has repeatedly called for a snap election with party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth insisting that Baroness Morgan‚Äôs leadership will be ‚Äúmore of the same‚Äù.

He said: ‚ÄúEluned Morgan will today become the third Labour leader in Wales in three months.

‚ÄúShe knows that for Welsh Government to have legitimacy in such circumstances, a fresh election is needed, as Labour themselves called for when both UK and Scottish governments went through successive leadership changes.

‚ÄúBut they won‚Äôt allow an election, and will do all they can, including teaming up with the Conservatives, to stop that happening, it seems.‚Äù

Shadow Welsh secretary accuses Labour of ‚Äòtaking Wales for granted‚Äô
The new shadow secretary of state for Wales has accused Labour of ‚Äútaking Wales for granted‚Äù after his party, the Conservatives, were wiped out there.

Lord Davies of Gower, who sits in the House of Lords, has taken on the shadow Cabinet role after the Tories lost every MP in Wales.

Lord Davies told peers that Wales was only named once in the King‚Äôs Speech and urged the Government to match the previous Government‚Äôs commitments to the Welsh people.

He said: ‚ÄúWales was only named once and that was in reference to the Government‚Äôs plan to make a Council of the Nations and Regions.

‚ÄúAnd sadly, I believe this could well be a reality check for what is to come, that is Labour once again taking Wales for granted.‚Äù

He claimed that the difference in delivery between the last Government and the current one ‚Äúseems very stark‚Äù.

He asked: ‚ÄúWho was it that delivered an additional ¬£18billion, the biggest block grant in the history of devolution to Wales? It was the Conservatives.

‚ÄúWho delivered two freeports and two investment zones for Wales? The Conservatives.

‚ÄúWho delivered two cuts to national insurance to help Welsh workers? The Conservatives.

‚ÄúAnd who protected more than 100,000 jobs from being lost with an ambitious furlough scheme? Yes, it was the Conservatives.‚Äù

Suella Braverman has been tipped to launch a bid for the Tory leadership as she warned the Tories must not become ‚Äúa collection of fanatical, irrelevant, centrist cranks‚Äù.

On Tuesday, she used a slot guest-hosting a radio programme to argue that ‚Äúwe had quite a centrist Conservative agenda‚Äù and that ‚Äúidentity politics got out of control‚Äù under Sunak.

‚ÄúWe need to be a party that‚Äôs firm and credible on immigration,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe need to give some hope to the British people on taxation, robust on security and defence, and a real champion for common-sense British values. None of this divisive identity politics and woke nonsense. It really frustrates me that that has happened on our watch.‚Äù

Braverman later dodged a caller‚Äôs question on whether she would throw her hat in the ring.
